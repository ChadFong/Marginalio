Was it really because, as Adam Gopnik put it, &#x201C;All dogs are Democrats and all cats Republicans&#x201D;? What about what Anthony Lane so wisely suggested, that the endless loyalty and good cheer of dogs is a dangerous misrepresentation of life, and that &#x201C;truth is cats&#x201D;? There&#x2019;s an upcoming show at the Japan Society, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.japansociety.org/page/programs/gallery/life-of-cats\" target=\"_blank\">Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection</a>,&#x201D; of woodblock prints from the Edo period (1615-1867), depicting the life of Japanese cats, from the cozy to the ferocious. The prints are divided into helpful subcategories like Cats and People, Cats Versus People, and Cats as People&#x2014;in one piquant image, an elaborately berobed cat woman leans on the head of a giant octopus while swatting a soup ladle at some flying fish. (Cats as people is a popular fantasy in Japanese culture&#x2014;the Kitty of Hello Kitty is apparently <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-hello-kitty-in-los-angeles-not-a-cat-20140826-column.html#page=1\" target=\"_blank\">not a cat but a &#x201C;little girl.&#x201D;</a>) One afternoon, while researching the Japan Society show, I typed &#x201C;Japanese cats&#x201D; into Google, hoping to find more Edo-period images. Instead, I unearthed this treasure: <a href=\"http://nekozushi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">sushi cats</a>. Or, if you want to sound like you know what you&#x2019;re talking about: <em>nekozushi</em>.

The star of the recording is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSFHLjwG2PQ\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Hymel</a>, the young American tenor who rose to fame when he substituted for Marcello Giordani in the role of &#xC9;n&#xE9;e in Berlioz&#x2019;s &#x201C;Les Troyens,&#x201D; at the Metropolitan Opera in 2012. The emergence of a first-rate tenor is always a cause for celebration, but Hymel&#x2019;s rare gift for singing the French &#x201C;heroic&#x201D; repertory&#x2014;which demands a unique mixture of power, refinement, and technical flexibility in the highest vocal register&#x2014;makes him doubly valuable.&#x2014;<em>Russell Platt</em></p> <figure class=\"alignnone size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Scott-Internet-Poetry-320.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span class=\"caption-text\">A screenshot from Penny Goring&#x2019;s &#x201C;<small>DELETIA</small>&#x2014;self portrait with no self.&#x201D;</span> <span class=\"credit\">Image courtesy New Museum</span></figcaption></figure> <p>This week, Kenneth Goldsmith made <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/post-internet-poetry-comes-of-age\">a strong case for post-Internet poetry</a>, writing on Page-Turner that the form has come into its own. This should come as no surprise, given that the Internet is a text-based medium, driven by code. What did surprise me was that Goldsmith restricted his argument to printed matter: a three-part volume, a book-length confession, an anthology. (In the past, he has championed YouTube&#x2019;s jejune bard of ranting, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/steveroggenbuck\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Roggenbuck</a>.) The most radical aspect of post-internet art isn&#x2019;t that it infiltrates old-media institutions like books and galleries; it&#x2019;s that, as it does so, it continues to proliferate online like Tribbles on Star Trek.&#xA0;As part of its&#xA0;current triennial,&#xA0;the New Museum tapped the&#xA0;British poet Harry Burke to organize <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/poetry-as-practice\" target=\"_blank\">a series of&#xA0;Web-only projects</a> by six other poets: Alex Turgeon, Penny Goring, Tan Lin, Ye Mimi, Melissa Broder, and the collective not I.&#xA0;A new&#xA0;piece is released every Monday, through April 6th.

He enlisted the help of some of his favorite artists, including Mark Knopfler, Taj Mahal, Mavis Staples, Natalie Cole, and George Benson. The resulting album, &#x201C;Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue,&#x201D; his thirty-fifth studio release, comes out March 23rd. Morrison, never one to go for the obvious, focusses on his lesser-known material, and over the past few weeks he&#x2019;s been posting singles on YouTube.&#xA0;The first one was &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM6LGK-1wJyNl7q21_3RI-w\" target=\"_blank\">Real Real Gone</a>,&#x201D; with the jazz singer Michael Bubl&#xE9;. The last one, &#x201C;Fire in the Belly,&#x201D; with Steve Winwood, is coming next week, on March 17th. This week saw Mark Knopfler lending his earthy voice to &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oPb2Ma9z2M\" target=\"_blank\">Irish Heartbeat</a>.&#x201D; But my favorite so far was the album&#x2019;s opening track, for which the late Bobby Womack joined Morrison on a dressed-up and slightly funky version of &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t1x6bpHOYU\" target=\"_blank\">Some Peace of Mind</a>.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s one of Womack&#x2019;s last recordings, and his voice gives the chorus an added poignancy.<em>&#x2014;John Donohue</em></p> <p class=\"media-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"380\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vqo13Ga5o_Q\"></iframe></p> <p>There&#x2019;s a noble tradition of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wes-anderson-classics-and-commercials\">directors exerting</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOhDo2ZoOig\" target=\"_blank\">extending their art</a> in commercials, and Nathan Silver is the latest one to rise to the challenge. The prolific filmmaker has made a feature a year since 2012. &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/soft-in-the-head\">Soft in the Head</a>&#x201D; came out last year; two (&#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/uncertain-terms\">Uncertain Terms</a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;Stinking Heaven&#x201D;) are still awaiting release. All three are harshly realistic, furiously histrionic glimpses into the harrowing lives of troubled people living in a variety of group homes&#x2014;a mental-health facility, a home for pregnant teen-agers, a self-regulated rehab house. Silver&#x2019;s commercial is an advertisement for a cell-phone camera and the processor that it runs on, and it&#x2019;s both a work of great originality and a startling new direction for the filmmaker.</p> <a class=\"tny-slot\" name=\"/3\"></a><a class=\"tny-page\" name=\"/2\"></a><p>The commercial has a title, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqo13Ga5o_Q\" target=\"_blank\">Family Affair</a>,&#x201D; and it&#x2019;s essentially a meta-film, one in which the making of the commercial&#x2014;the commission and Silver&#x2019;s uncertainty about it&#x2014;is folded into the action. The director builds the commercial around a recorded phone call with its creative supervisor, who responds to Silver&#x2019;s queries by describing, in sketch-like form, the kind of film he wants. Silver puckishly takes that recording as a wry voice-over that he brings to life with a freewheeling visual style&#x2014;and he cuts that voice-over up and edits it into a sort of musical score that lends the film a lyrical, through-composed structure. Silver appears in the film, along with his mother, Cindy Silver, who often acts in dramatic roles in his films. But here she plays herself&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s quite an engaging character on her own. I was walking through Grand Central Station one morning when I ran into Silver and the two members of his crew. He seemed happy and excited as he told me that he was waiting for his mother to arrive so that he could shoot a film with her there. Clearly, Silver found the ostensibly commercial premise of his film a springboard for his inspiration. So do I.<em>&#x2014;Richard Brody</em></p>     \n  \n\n\n\n    <nav class=\"social-buttons\"></nav>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

    "content": "<div><div class=\"post\">\n  \n  <p class=\"date\">19 Apr 2008</p>\n  <p>I want to take a moment to elaborate on what makes a well formed commit message. I think the best practices for commit message formatting is one of the little details that makes Git great. Understandably, some of the first commits to rails.git have messages of the really-long-line variety, and I want to expand on why this is a poor practice.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#x2019;s a model Git commit message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary\n\nMore detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72\ncharacters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the\nsubject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank\nline separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit\nthe body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the\ntwo together.\n\nWrite your commit message in the imperative: \"Fix bug\" and not \"Fixed bug\"\nor \"Fixes bug.\"  This convention matches up with commit messages generated\nby commands like git merge and git revert.\n\nFurther paragraphs come after blank lines.\n\n- Bullet points are okay, too\n\n- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a\n  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here\n\n- Use a hanging indent</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let&#x2019;s start with a few of the reasons why wrapping your commit messages to 72 columns is a good thing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>git log</code> doesn&#x2019;t do any special special wrapping of the commit messages. With the default pager of <code>less -S</code>, this means your paragraphs flow far off the edge of the screen, making them difficult to read. On an 80 column terminal, if we subtract 4 columns for the indent on the left and 4 more for symmetry on the right, we&#x2019;re left with 72 columns.</li>\n\n<li><code>git format-patch --stdout</code> converts a series of commits to a series of emails, using the messages for the message body. Good email netiquette dictates we wrap our plain text emails such that there&#x2019;s room for a few levels of nested reply indicators without overflow in an 80 column terminal. (The current rails.git workflow doesn&#x2019;t include email, but who knows what the future will bring.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vim users can meet this requirement by installing my <a href=\"http://github.com/tpope/vim-git\">vim-git runtime files</a>, or by simply setting the following option in your git commit message file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:set textwidth=72</code></pre>\n\n<p>For Textmate, you can adjust the &#x201C;Wrap Column&#x201D; option under the view menu, then use <code>^Q</code> to rewrap paragraphs (be sure there&#x2019;s a blank line afterwards to avoid mixing in the comments). Here&#x2019;s a shell command to add 72 to the menu so you don&#x2019;t have to drag to select each time:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ defaults write com.macromates.textmate OakWrapColumns '( 40, 72, 78 )'</code></pre>\n\n<p>More important than the mechanics of formatting the body is the practice of having a subject line. As the example indicates, you should shoot for about 50 characters (though this isn&#x2019;t a hard maximum) and always, always follow it with a blank line. This first line should be a concise summary of the changes introduced by the commit; if there are any technical details that cannot be expressed in these strict size constraints, put them in the body instead. The subject line is used all over Git, oftentimes in truncated form if too long of a message was used. The following are just a handful of examples of where it ends up:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>git log --pretty=oneline</code> shows a terse history mapping containing the commit id and the summary</li>\n\n<li><code>git rebase --interactive</code> provides the summary for each commit in the editor it invokes</li>\n\n<li>if the config option <code>merge.summary</code> is set, the summaries from all merged commits will make their way into the merge commit message</li>\n\n<li><code>git shortlog</code> uses summary lines in the changelog-like output it produces</li>\n\n<li><code>git format-patch</code>, <code>git send-email</code>, and related tools use it as the subject for emails</li>\n\n<li>reflogs, a local history accessible with <code>git reflog</code> intended to help you recover from stupid mistakes, get a copy of the summary</li>\n\n<li><code>gitk</code> has a column for the summary</li>\n\n<li>GitHub uses the summary in various places in their user interface</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The subject/body distinction may seem unimportant but it&#x2019;s one of many subtle factors that makes Git history so much more pleasant to work with than Subversion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
